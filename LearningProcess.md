## What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.
The Feynman Technique is a method for learning and understanding complex topics. It is named after the physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for his ability to explain difficult concepts in simple terms.
The Feynman Technique involves four steps:
- Choose a topic that you want to learn or understand.
- Pretend that you are explaining the topic to someone else who is not familiar with it.
- Write down your explanation in simple, clear language, using examples and analogies to make the topic easier to understand.
- Review your explanation and identify any gaps in your understanding. Go back to the source material and fill in any gaps in your knowledge.
