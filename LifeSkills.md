# NoSQL
A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key–value pair, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as "more flexible" than relational database tables.

# Types of NoSQL databases
NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.
- Key/Value store 
- Document database
- Column oriented database
- Graph database 

# When to use NoSQL
- NoSQL are good fit for the rapid agile devlopment, NoSQL allows developer to in control of the structure of data.
- Gives a upper hand to handelling the semi-structured and the un-structured data.
- To handel the de-centerlised NoSQL is very effective and effecnt.
- NoSQL is designed to handel the situation like hardware fail to minimise the down time.
